  2016-06-25
  
  * Heavy functional change to the panopticon:
    * It now has radar radius of 6000 instead of 1200.
    * Increased base energy consumption to 10000, from 5000.    
    * It now uses its current radar radius as its max view distance, instead of 8000.
    * It can no longer spy on support commanders.        
    * It now uses only your own intel to decide what to view. This means:
      * Better performance:
        * Formerly, for each opponent, it would use that players intel, filter out units that that player didn't control and cloaked units, and add those units to its list. Then check again at a larger radius (its radius + Darkess stealth field radius) for Darkness facilities, and check the distances of units on the first list to Darkness facilities list, and remove any too close.
      * It now respects stealth:
        * There is no easy way of checking if a unit is affected by a stealth field in script, only if it is emitting a stealth field. This means in the old system it would have needed to something similar to the Darkness check for each stealth field generator. Now that it only checks your own intel it doesn't know about stealthed units or units in stealth fields to begin with.
      * Darkness facilities no longer get free immunity to the Panopticon:
        * If the Darkess loses power or you get intel on its location some other way, standard game rules on intel apply; its a building and its not going anywhere. It gets spied on.

    * Now classified as Experimental Reconstruction Engineer.
    * Its reclaim now works as normal units except that if it reclaims a unit or wreckage it adds that unit or wreckages blueprint to its build list and spawns a drone.
      * This drone works like an engineering drone, except if it dies the Iyadesu loses access to the blueprint.
      * It has a limit of 8 drones.        
    * It now also has the ability to rebuild destroyed buildings in the same way as the SACUs.

__________.__________
2015-09-05|0.7

* Fixed the third arm and thread accumalation of the Darkness.
* Fixed the first arm on the distance model of the Darkness.
* Changed the Darkness to use the default buffs system for applying its debuffs. This has the following effects:
  * Effect is no longer affected by distance.
  * It no longer has to specifically tracks units. Meaning it no longer crashes crash when one of them dies before it does, and uses less system resources.
  * Its now multiple stacking buffs with a duration, rather than defined specifically each time.
  * Units leaving the area will now eventually lose the effect.
* Fixed a bug in the vanilla buff definitions that references RADAR radius instead of OMNI radius when calculating the base size of omni buffs.
  * Unfortunately this causes log warnings every time the a unit with a omni buff has its buffs change. But that is to do with how bad the vanilla code is.
* Darkness now stops firing pulses when it doesn't have power. To some degree.
  __________
  2015-09-06

  * Added a hat attach bone for the observation satellite.
  * Crates: Changed the vision buff to use actual buffs, rather than an attached vis entity.
  * Crates: Changed the health buff to use actual buffs, rather than just multiplying the units health. They now stack with other buffs like upgrades and veterency rather than being replaced by them. Buff is now x1.5 rather than x2.
  * Crates: Clones now get a copy of the original units buff table, and then have their current health set to that of the original.
  * Crates: Kills drop now only gives kills to units with defined veterency levels, and gives an amount of kills at random from the units veterancy levels table.
  * Crates: Added a radar buff. Only activates if the unit has radar. Buff is 25%.
  * Crates: Added weapon buff. Adds 10% to damage and aoe, and 25% to max range. Only applies to units with damage dealing weapons that aren't death weapons.
  * Crates: Added movement speed buff. Value is 20%. Only applies if the unit isn't movement type 'RULEUMT_None'.
  * Crates: Added build rate buff. Buff is x2. Only applies to units with a build speed.
  * Crates: Added 'Jackpot' variations of each buff, which are an order of magnitude more powerfull, and have a 1% chance of replacing the original.
  __________
  2015-09-12
  
  * Crates: Removed the damage radius buff from the crate weapon buff. Because the function to set damage radius doesn't exist. Its another bugged buff.
  * Crates: Fixed the weapons check on the weapons buff.
  * Crates: Changed the free mass drop to check available storage. Rerolls if less than 5K remaining storage. It now gives 10% of remaining storage worth of mass, or 5000 mass, which ever is bigger. With a 1% chance of outright filling your storage.
  * Crates: Added floating text box messages to drops. They use default language strings so I don't have to get translations done. Also means some are a bit odd.
  * Paragon game: More intelligent placement of units after the paragon:
    * It now tries to spawns the shields near where it actually spawned the paragon, rather than where it tried to spawn the paragon.
  * Crates: No longer freezes the game if it can't find a safe place to warp to. Warps to the same place instead. Which can have hilarious consequences.
  __________

  * Added a basic version of the Panopticon: UEF Experimental Sensor Array.

  __________
  2015-07-29
  
  * Made the ADGs 'eyes' stop moving more often.
  * Airborne bombers of the same type on the same team can no longer damage each other.
    * This most specifically deals with the fact that a group of bombers attacking an Iron Curtain will almost certainly all kill eachother with their own bombs impacting the shield, but also affects experimental bombers hurting each other all the time when in groups.
  __________
  2015-08-01
  
  * Overhauled the previous Iron Curtain bomber self damage fix.
    * Rather than doing a load of self and instigator checks on damage to make sure this only effects bombers of the same type on the same team that are also in the air it now does the following: 
    * The damage type of each weapon with the variable NeedToComputeBombDrop that has the DamageType 'Normal' now has the damage type 'NormalBomb'. This includes all bombers' and fighter/bombers' bombs except corsair which doesn't bomb strictly speaking. This is computed during launch.
    * When taking the damage the following checks are made:
      * Am I a bomber?
      * Am I in the air?
      * Is the damage type NormalBomb.                 
    * If the answer to all those is yes it takes 5% damage instead.
      * This can still lead to a clumped group of 30 UEF T1 bombers damaging the bombers at the back of the group to half health
        * This is preferable to killing the whole group, whilst also giving some feedback on the bombers flying through the fire.
  __________
  2015-08-05
  
  * Centurion changes:
    * Speed reduced from 15 to 9. (Still faster than the Soul Ripper, which is 8 I think)

    * Fixed the forever broken, but always existant, rear AA laser.
    * Added an additional light gattling cannon to the underside of the tail for air-to-ground attacks. DPS ~320.
    * It can now wear a hat.
  * Paragon game: Fixed an issue where the script would crash after failing to give someone a Paragon or shield due to map issues. The player will still be Paragon or shieldless, but the game will log a warning and carry on with life.
  __________
  2015-08-07
  
  * Paragon Game: If the script couldn't spawn a unit it will now try again a little bit closer to the players starting location. (Except for people in the center of the map.)
    * If ANY player doesn't have the unit after these checks, it will try a third time (or second time in middle people cases) to spawn, but this time right on their starting location.
      * If the Paragon fails to this point, the shields will also be spawned this way.
      * Players who have STILL been failed by the spawn script, will have the failure announced on their behalf. So people know the game is ruined and that you should all try a different map.

  2015-01-16

    * The tech 2 version gets a 50% discount on upgrading to it, so its functionally the same that way.
    * Building it directly results in a net profit of 50 mass and 250 energy compared to upgrading to it.
  * Cybran Hive changes:
    * Third level of it is now tech 3, costs 4 times as much, and is directly buildable.
    * The second level gets a 75% discount on building it.

  __________
  2014-12-23

  * The pancake script now also checks the maximum speed of the Centurion, and adjusts the ideal kill angle estimation appropriately.
    * For if I adjust the Centurion speed again, and if I apply the script to other experimental fliers.
  * Increased the air speed of the Centurion from 12 to 15. (Original 18)
  * Added a work around for removal of things on walls sometimes causing it to lose its path blocking if the removed thing had the same or larger footprint.

    * The Scathis MK 2 can't be built with no Game Enders, on its original code now.
      * It is also back to its old unit code for compatibility with other mods.
      * This also fixed the bug whereby with BrewLAN disabled the Scathis icon was still the Scathis Mk 2.
      * And a bug whereby the rebuild bonus wasn't working due to it referencing the current (and original) unit code.      
    * The Cybran Shields, and tech 1 shields are no longer buildable with no Bubbles (Asuming you are running a version for which no-bubbles isn't bugged.)

  * Script for handling sweeping changes of categories is now slightly more efficient.
  * Crystal Hill now removes civilian buildings from the direct center of the map, and spawns the crystal in the exact position of the first of those buildings, if there were any.
    * However the script no longer cares if anything else is blocking the location, or if the ground is flat.
    * This is better for maps where uneven terrain would make the crystal appear nearer one player.
    * The crystal sometimes has its underside visible.

__________.__________
2014-09-22|0.4.E

* Changed the gate sections to be a seperate building to the wall sections instead of an upgrade of the afforementioned.
  * As much as I prefered the lack of UI clutter it being an upgrade came with, it had three unfortunate side effects:
    * It ocasionally broke adjacency script for them.
    * You couldn't have them in templates.
    * It made the gate sections be repaired virtually instantly by anything. (They both still repair to fast anyway.)

  * Improved the LOD1 mesh of the Gantry, so the arms move at a distance, and the floatation legs also appear at a distance.
  __________
  2014-09-03
  
  * The Hades now has an overheat effect: A small explosion dealing 500 damage, usually only to itself, a small fire, and some smoke that lasts most of the 16 cooldown time.

* Changed the description of the cybran armored wall.
* Modified the onlclick function of a buildmenu buttons to check if the unit clicked is buildable by the Gantry and one of the units selected is the Gantry.
  * This allows units to both be Gantry built and Engineer built, without any wierdness with fake units that become the real thing.
* Removed the fake Fatboy, Atlantis, and Centurion.
* Made the real Centurion buildable by engineers.
* Removed the part of the script that was making the Fatboy and Atlantis Gantry only. (Also effected experimentals from BlackOps and Total Meyhem)

  * Did a work around fix for the Scathis MkII not being disabled when game enders are off.
    * Changed my modded version to have the original code and replace it entirely. Will cause problemts with other mods that alter the Scathis.
  * Created a ghetto work around for the Atlantis getting stuck in the Gantry. Very ghetto fix.
  __________
  2014-08-27
  
  * Created a script class for the UEF engineering resource generators, so there is less copied code.   
    * Script now checks how far away the instigator is, and does nothing if its too far away, then checks the instigator layer instead of its categories when deciding what to build.
      * Too far away is considered over *3 its visual range.
      * If the units layer is water it alternates between trying to build a torpedo or point defence, incase it can't reach the water for a torpedo.
  * The Engineering Power Generator now aims with all its arms, instead of just the first.
  * Fixed a long standing bug with the Gantry being able to have its costs reduced, through adjacency, to 0 of any one resource.
